# Electron-Optics

Electron-Optics is a useful tool in the field of electron and ion optics.

The application allows users to compute the axial potential distribution of cylindrical thin-walled electrostatic lenses. 
Additionally, it computes the paraxial ray trajectories of electron (or ion) beams under the condition of low energy (beam energy less than 300 eV).
