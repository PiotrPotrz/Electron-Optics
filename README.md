# Electron-Optics

Electron-Optics is a useful tool in the field of electron and ion optics.

The application allows users to compute the axial potential distribution of cylindrical thin-walled electrostatic lenses. The number, radii, lengths, and gaps between the lens electrodes are fully customizable.

Additionally, the software computes the paraxial ray trajectories of electron (or ion) beams under the condition of low energy (beam energy less than 300 eV). Both the starting position of the beam and the inclination are set by the user.

The results of the calculations are presented in the form of matplotlib pyplot plots. The potential distributions are also saved in txt files, which can be reused to expedite future calculations.
